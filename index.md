# Project Goals
We are developing an app to help owners find their lost pets. This app will allow users to upload photos of strays they have seen while they are outside and geotag the location in which they were seen. Owners can come in and upload a photo of their lost pet and check through the posts that have been posted after they were lost and look at all those posts that match within a certain area. We are hoping to help owners find their lost pets quicker and easier than before.

# Project Video
We should place our video at the end of the semester after the goals.
